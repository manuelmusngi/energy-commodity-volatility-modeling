#### 🌐 Natural Gas Volatility Forecasting Inference

A research‑driven, production‑ready analytics framework for forecasting natural gas volatility and translating market signals into hedge timing and risk insights for decision-making.  

This project integrates fundamentals, storage dynamics, and market structure into a modular Python pipeline designed for quantitative research, risk management, and trading decision support.


#### 📌 Project Objective
Build an end‑to‑end volatility forecasting system that:
- Models natural gas price uncertainty using historical and forward‑looking signals
- Identifies volatility regimes relevant for hedge timing
- Bridges academic research and real‑world risk workflows


#### 🧠 Research Reference Foundation
Grounded in peer‑reviewed and working‑paper literature on natural gas markets, storage dynamics, and volatility modeling, including:

- Stochastic Path‑Dependent Volatility Models for Price‑Storage Dynamics in Natural Gas Markets (arXiv)

  [Stochastic Path-Dependent Volatility Models for Price-Storage Dynamics in Natural Gas Markets and Discrete-Time Swing Option Pricing](https://github.com/manuelmusngi/Natural-Gas-Volatility-Forecasting-Hedge-Timing/blob/main/Natural%20Gas%20Markets%20and%20Discrete-Time%20.pdf)
  
- Academic and SSRN research on storage surprises, fundamentals, and hedging effectiveness
 
  [Natural gas price, market fundamentals and hedging effectiveness](https://github.com/manuelmusngi/Natural-Gas-Volatility-Forecasting-Hedge-Timing/blob/main/Natural%20Gas%20Price%2C%20Market%20Fundamentals%20and%20Hedging%20Effectiveness.pdf )

  [Optimal Hedging Strategies for Natural Gas](https://github.com/manuelmusngi/Natural-Gas-Volatility-Forecasting-Hedge-Timing/blob/main/Optimal_Hedging_Strategies_for_Natural_Gas.pdf)
   
The implementation reflects a reduced‑form, data‑driven interpretation of these models suitable for operational use.


All analytics are orchestrated within a single, fully documented Jupyter notebook, making the project easy to review, extend, and adapt.

#### 🚀 Key Takeaway
This repository demonstrates how academic volatility concepts can be transformed into a practical hedge‑timing and risk analytics tool for natural gas markets—balancing rigor, interpretability, and operational relevance.
